echo "========================================="
echo ""

echo "PHASE 1: MINIMAL TESTING"
echo "------------------------"
echo "1. Starting dashboard and measuring initial load time..."
echo "2. Testing single stats query..."
echo "3. Verifying cache behavior..."
echo ""

echo "PHASE 2: SIMPLIFIED TESTING"  
echo "---------------------------"
echo "1. Testing with small collection (<100 memories)..."
echo "2. Testing cache hit/miss scenarios..."
echo "3. Measuring search/recall performance..."
echo ""

echo "PHASE 3: COMPLEX TESTING"
echo "------------------------"
echo "1. Testing with large collection (>500 memories)..."
echo "2. Testing concurrent operations..."
echo "3. End-to-end performance measurement..."
echo ""

echo "EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "- Stats query: 8-10s ‚Üí <1s"
echo "- Cache hit: <50ms"
echo "- Search operations: No stats refresh (faster)"
echo "- Overall responsiveness: Significant improvement"
echo ""

echo "PERFORMANCE LOGS TO MONITOR:"
echo "- Server console: Look for cache HIT/MISS messages"
echo "- Browser console: Look for timing measurements"
echo "- Dashboard UI: Check cache age indicator"
echo ""

echo "MANUAL TESTING STEPS:"
echo "1. Start dashboard: npm run dev"
echo "2. Open browser console"
echo "3. Perform search operations (should NOT refresh stats)"
echo "4. Perform store operation (should refresh stats)"
echo "5. Wait 30+ seconds and perform another operation (cache miss)"
echo "6. Monitor cache status indicator in UI"

echo "‚úÖ Testing script ready. Start dashboard and follow manual steps."
