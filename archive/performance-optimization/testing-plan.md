TESTING PLAN: MCP-MEMORY-DASHBOARD Performance Optimization
Date: 2025-06-08
Issue: #10 - Stats query performance improvement

SYSTEMATIC TESTING APPROACH (Memory-Driven Development):

PHASE 1: MINIMAL TESTING
- Test basic functionality with optimized server
- Verify cache hit/miss behavior
- Measure single stats call timing

PHASE 2: SIMPLIFIED TESTING  
- Test with small collection (<100 memories)
- Test with medium collection (100-500 memories)
- Verify cache TTL behavior

PHASE 3: COMPLEX TESTING
- Test with large collection (>500 memories) 
- Test concurrent access patterns
- Test cache invalidation scenarios
- Measure end-to-end dashboard performance

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- Stats query: 8-10s â†’ <1s
- Cache hit: <50ms
- Cache miss: <500ms for large collections
- Overall dashboard responsiveness: Noticeable improvement

METRICS TO TRACK:
1. Server-side stats computation time
2. Cache hit/miss ratio
3. End-to-end query response time
4. Frontend responsiveness
5. Memory usage impact

FRONTEND OPTIMIZATIONS NEEDED:
1. Reduce stats refresh frequency
2. Implement lazy loading for stats
3. Add manual refresh option
4. Show cache status to user
