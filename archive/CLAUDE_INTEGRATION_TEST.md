## ðŸ§ª CLAUDE DASHBOARD INTEGRATION TEST

### Step 1: List Available MCP Servers
Ask Claude: "List all available MCP servers and their tools"

Expected result: You should see a 'memory' server with dashboard tools.

### Step 2: Test Dashboard Health Tool
Ask Claude: "Use the dashboard_check_health tool"

Expected result:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "health": 100,
  "avg_query_time": 0
}
```

### Step 3: Test Database Health Tool  
Ask Claude: "Use the check_database_health tool"

Expected result: Database statistics including memory count and validation status.

### Step 4: If Tools Are Not Available
1. Restart Claude Desktop application
2. Check that the memory server is configured in Claude Desktop config
3. Verify the paths in the config are correct

### Step 5: Integration Success Test
If the above tools work, the dashboard integration is complete!
The dashboard will be able to call these tools and display real data instead of static values.
